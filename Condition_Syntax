-eq 	Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not; if yes, then the condition becomes true. 	[ $a -eq $b ] is not true.

-ne 	Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not; if values are not equal, then the condition becomes true. 	[ $a -ne $b ] is true.

-gt 	Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true. 	[ $a -gt $b ] is not true.

-lt 	Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true. 	[ $a -lt $b ] is true.

-ge 	Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true. 	[ $a -ge $b ] is not true.

-le 	Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true. 	[ $a -le $b ] is true.
